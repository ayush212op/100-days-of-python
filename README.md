## 🚧 Status: **In Progress**

📌 I'm currently on **Day 13** of my Python journey.  
This project is actively growing with new concepts and examples added regularly.  
More to come as I progress!

## 🚀 About This Project

This is my complete **100 Days of Python** learning journey — compiled into **one single, structured Python program**.

Instead of splitting each day into multiple files, I've written everything in one place to make it easier to read, understand, and follow along — without needing to skip around or open many files.

## 💡 What’s Inside?

This is my **complete 100 Days of Python** journey  
packed into **one structured and readable file**.

- ✅ No scattered files or folders  
- ✅ Scroll-friendly, single file format  
- ✅ From basics to advanced — all in one place

> *"I didn’t want 100 files...  
I wanted 100 lessons in one epic script."*

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run the script:

```bash
python filename.py
```

> ⚠️ Requires Python version **3.10+**  
> 💬 Most executable code is commented out  
to avoid errors when running everything at once.  
You can uncomment specific sections to test them.
